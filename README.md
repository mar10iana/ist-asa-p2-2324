**Achievement**: This project was awarded a grade of 18,75 out of 20.

## Overview

This project is a part of the Analysis and Synthesis of Algorithms course at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico for the 2023/2024 academic year. 
The objective is to analyze the spread of infectious diseases within the Portuguese population using data from the TugaNet social network,
with a focus on identifying the maximum number of transmission "hops" in a worst-case scenario.

### Input Specifications

- The input starts with a line containing two integers `n` and `m`, representing the number of individuals and relationships, respectively.
- It is followed by `m` lines, each containing two integers `x` and `y`, indicating that individual `x` knows individual `y`.

### Output Specifications

- The program should output the maximum number of hops a disease can make within the network, represented by a single integer `s`.
